## A project on:
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the with statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Requirements
- All  files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3
- Code follows PEP 8 style

## Tasks

 **[0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py)** - A function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
 **[1-number_of_lines.py](1-number_of_lines.py)** - A function that returns the number of lines of a text file
 **[2-read_lines.py](2-read_lines.py)** - A function that reads n lines of a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
 **[3-write_file.py](3-write_file.py)** - A function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written
 **[4-append_write.py](4-append_write.py)** - A function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added
 **[5-to_json_string.py](5-to_json_string.py)** - A function that returns the JSON representation of an object
 **[6-from_json_string.py](6-from_json_string.py)** - A function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
 **[7-save_to_json_file.py](7-save_to_json_file.py)** - A function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation 
 **[8-load_from_json_file.py](8-load_from_json_file.py)** - A function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
 **[9-add_item.py](9-add_item.py)** - A script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
 **[10-class_to_json.py](10-class_to_json.py)** - A function that returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object:
 **[11-student.py](11-student.py)** - Creation of `Student` class
 **[12-student.py](12-student.py)** - `Student` class:
 - to_json` method retrieves dict representation of Student instance
 **[13-student.py](13-student.py)** - `Student` class:
