Div must be a number
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "R"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

Matrix must have same row length
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix2, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Matrix must consist of integers/floats
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix3, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Div cannot be zero
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Divide by 2 rounded to 2 decimal places
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Does not change original matrix
>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
